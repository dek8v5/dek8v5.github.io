  - role: Graduate Research Assistant 
    time: 2019 - Present
    company: Dr. Toni Kazic, University of Missouri
    details: |
      Developed five innovative end-to-end pipelines leveraging deep learning and computer vision to analyze complex lesion and maize phenotypes. Specialized in autonomous systems, remote sensing, image registration, object detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstructions: 
        - Developed MaiZaic, a robust pipeline for mosaicking freely flown aerial RGB video, contributing five novel features to the project: dynamic frame sampling, automated calibration, unsupervised homography estimation (CorNetv3), shot detection, and mini-mosaics to minimize error accumulation. Achieved 96.5% accuracy compared to ground truth, an 8.59% improvement over ASIFT.
        - Built CorNet, an unsupervised deep homography estimation pipeline to mosaic aerial imagery without telemetry, utilizing VGG8 architecture with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. CorNet achieved 10x faster processing with comparable accuracy to ASIFT.
        - Created DeepMaizeCounter (DMC), an advanced stand-counting algorithm for seedling maize using YOLOv4, YOLOv7, and YOLOv9. Automated row and range detection, and created a seedling maize dataset categorized into three population classes. Achieved an r² of 0.906 on raw frames and 0.616 on fragmented mosaics.
        - Developed PointillistMaize, generating 3D maize reconstructions from 360° aerial videos using Structure from Motion (SfM), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and Gaussian Splatting. Comparative analysis demonstrated that NeRF produces 90.4% of points and computes 7.3 times faster than SfM, while Gaussian Splatting produces 8.1% of points and operates 3.0 times faster than SfM.
        - Collaborated on the development of Video Mosaicking and Summarization (VMZ), a robust mosaicking of maize fields from aerial imagery, achieved over 95% SSIM across all test datasets through precise camera calibration in Python and MATLAB.

      Led UAV-based data collection and curation for mosaicking, stand counting, and 3D reconstructions. Designed and executed various flight strategies, including manual and automated trajectories.
      
      Imaged leaf data collection using still cameras for lesion segmentation.
    
      Participated in agricultural activities, including planting, managing, pollinating, and harvesting corn during field seasons.

        
  - role: Student Researcher
    time: January - December 2018
    company: Dr. John Lory, University of Missouri
    details: |
      - Stitched high-resolution aerial imagery using Pix4D for precise mapping in the University of Missouri Strip Trial Program, followed by segmentation of corn and soil areas to extract green values using Excess Green (ExG) and Red-Green (RG) indices to assess nitrogen deficiency.
      - Provided actionable recommendations for targeted nitrogen spray applications in deficient zones based on the analysis of green value indices.
      - Conducted detailed statistical analysis of UAV imagery, including creating field layouts and performing spatial analysis using ArcMap to forecast preliminary harvest outcomes.
      - Contributed to cover crop analysis by participating in data collection and ground-truthing efforts, ensuring the accuracy and enhancing the reliability of the UAV-based agricultural insights.
